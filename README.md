# ðŸ“¦ Barcode Generator and PDF Automation Tool

## About
**Barcode Generator** is a desktop automation tool developed as part of the *Technical Mailroom Assistant* role at **Fenway Mailroom, Boston University**.  
It recognizes recipient names and tracking numbers from Excel sheets, generates corresponding **Code128 barcodes**, and compiles them into a **print-ready PDF** for labeling and mailroom management.

## Features
- Reads Excel files (`.xls` / `.xlsx`) containing package data.  
- Generates **Code128 barcodes** for each tracking number.  
- Exports a clean, organized **PDF** with barcodes and recipient info.  
- Simple **Tkinter GUI** â€” no command line required.  
- Automatically paginates long barcode lists across multiple pages.  
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## How It Works
1. Select an Excel file containing tracking numbers and names.  
2. The script extracts data using **Pandas**.  
3. Each tracking number is converted into a **Code128 barcode**.  
4. Barcodes are arranged with names and codes on an **A4 PDF** using **ReportLab**.  
5. The final PDF is saved for printing and used in the mailroom for efficient package tracking.

## ðŸ§¾ Role Context

Developed during my time as a **Technical Mailroom Assistant** at **Boston University (Fenway Mailroom)** to automate package labeling, streamline barcode creation, and improve mailroom operational efficiency.  
This project reduced manual input errors and saved significant time in generating tracking labels for daily mail sorting.
